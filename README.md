# New Server Initialization

We spend a lot of time on DigitalOcean provisioning new servers, and have a standard configuration for LEMP stack servers. This is an evolving
quick setup script to help with doing the more mundane work.

Usage:

```
$> ./new-server.sh {username}
```

Just follow the prompts afterward.
